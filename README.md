# Icosikiatesimal Color Space

## Ico space 

- Is a new color space I've been working on. It adresses some of the issues I have with Hex and sRGB space

#### Namely 

- - The fact given a value such as '64', its not immediately clear if this is a sRGB or HEX Color value, so in reality this value could mean... 

`100 Decimal, 64 Hexidecimal,`

`or it could mean 64 Decimal, 48 Hexadecimal,` 

`and it could even potentially mean 100 Hexadecimal, 160 sRGB, or A0 Hexadecimal.` 

This is madness! We must fix this.
