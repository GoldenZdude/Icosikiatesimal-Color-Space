# Icosikiatesimal Color Space

#### Ico space is a new color space I've been working on. It adresses some of the issues I have with Hex and sRGB space

#### namely the fact given a value such as '64', its not immediately clear if this is a sRGB or HEX Color value, so in reality this value could mean:... 

### 100 Decimal, 64 Hexidecimal, or it could mean 64 Decimal, 48 Hexadecimal, and it could even potentially mean 100 Hexadecimal, 160 sRGB, or A0 Hexadecimal. This is madness! We must fix this.
